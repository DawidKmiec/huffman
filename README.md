HUFFMAN ENCODOING
place input.txt in the same folder as the bin
output will be created, formatted in chars, segmented neatly

how huffman encoding works:
explained [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iEm1NRyEe5c)

tallies text - sees what has the most characters
e.g.
A - 10
B - 7
C - 5
D - 5
E - 2
G - 1

least frequent nodes are joined, the connected abundance is sorted and it is treted like a normal number again
then on the 

DESIGN PLAN - 

READ THE INPUT FILE LINE BY LINE
COUNT THE ABUNDANCE OF EACH CHARACTER, USE A HASHMAP TO DO THIS CUZ WHY NOT
NVM DON'T OVERCOMPLICATE
